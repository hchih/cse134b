            <h3>Game Summary:</h3>
            <p>Chess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64
			smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen
			pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king.

            <h3>Rules Summary:</h3>
            <p>The primary objective in chess is to checkmate your opponent's King. When a King
			cannot avoid capture then it is checkmated and the game is immediately over. The game
			is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in check.
			
			Chess pieces include:
			<dl>
			  <dt><b><u>King</b></u>  
			  <small>The king is the most important piece on the chessboard. The king may move one 
			  square in any direction, including diagonally (except for castling). It can never be 
			  captured and if it is in danger then it must be made safe immediately. If it is not 
			  possible to make the king safe then the game is lost. When they are attacked by a piece 
			  of the opponent, it is called check, and when in a check that cannot be removed, they
			  are checkmated, and the game is lost for their owner.
			  <ul>
			    <li><em>Special moves: <mark>Castling</mark> </em>
			  </ul>
			  </small>
			  
			  <dt><b><u>Queen</b></u> 
			  <br><small>The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. This is because it can control 
			  more squares than any other chessman. It moves straight forward or backwards and diagonally 
			  any number of squares. However, it cannot jump over other pieces.</small>
			  
			  <dt><b><u> Bishop (2)</b></u> 
			  <br><small>The bishop moves to any square on the diagonals on which it stands. However, 
			  it is not allowed to jump over other pieces.</small>
			  
			  <dt><b><u>Knight (2)</b></u> 
			  <br><small>The knight's move is composed of two different steps; first, it makes one 
			  step of one single square along its rank or file, and then, still moving away from 
			  the square of departure, one step of one single square on a diagonal. It does not 
			  matter if the square of the first step is occupied.</small>
			  
			  <dt><b><u>Rook (2)</b></u> 
			  <br><small>The rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically, but it 
			  cannot jump over other pieces.</small>
			  
			  <dt><b><u>Pawn (8)</b></u> 
			  <br><small>The pawn normally moves only forward.
			  <ul>
			    <li>First move: 
				<li>Capturing: It It advances from its original square either one or two vacant 
				squares along the file on which it is placed, and on subsequent moves it 
				advances one vacant square along the file. advances one square along either of 
				the diagonals on which it stands
				<li><em>Special moves: <mark> En passant, Promotion</mark> </em>
			  </ul>
